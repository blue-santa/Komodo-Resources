<p><code>&quot;LP_trades_alicevalidate {COIN} src {TXID} failed SPV check&quot;</code> - The UTXO you attempted to trade is not valid according to the SPV server. This is could be the result of a bad connection to the SPV server, a misconfigured SPV server or another wallet spending that UTXO.</p>
<p><code>&quot;quote {COIN}/{COIN} validate error {price}&quot;</code> - The quote you received after placing this order is no longer valid.</p>

<p><code>&quot;error&quot;:&quot;not enough utxo, please make more deposits&quot;</code> - You don't have the appropriate UTXOs for the trade you are attempting to make. You need UTXOs in a ratio of X:&gt;(X/777). X is the amount you would like to trade.</p>
<p><code>&quot;error&quot;:&quot;no orderbook entry found to handle request&quot;</code> - No Bob was willing to fill your request. If you do see Bobs in the orderbook, try different UTXOs sizes or a higher price.</p>
<p><code>&quot;error&quot;:&quot;cant find a deposit that is close enough in size. make another deposit that is just a bit larger than what you want to trade&quot;</code> - You don't have the appropriate UTXOs for the trade you are attempting to make. If you do in fact have the UTXOs, it is possible they may be locked from previous failed swaps. Restart the marketmaker if so.</p>
